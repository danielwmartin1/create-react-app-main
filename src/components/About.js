                    <p>
                        I dedicated 15 years as a nurse to helping others and solving complex healthcare challenges, honing analytical skills, attention to detail, and critical thinking. Driven by a passion for problem-solving, I transitioned into software development, focusing on creating innovative solutions through technology. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve mastered full-stack development, working with languages and frameworks like JavaScript, Python, React, and Node.js. I thrive on continuous learning, tackling new challenges, and exploring emerging technologies to deepen my expertise and contribute to impactful tech projects.
